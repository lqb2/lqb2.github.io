		<p>Hi! I'm excited to support you or your organization in your work! Below are my pricing guidelines, some testimonials, my availability, and an abbreviated client list. Please check this out and then let's get on the phone (or video is even better!). Email is the best way to be in touch: lawrence@lqb2.co. Thanks and I'm looking forward to connecting.

<h2 id="content">Pricing</h2>
<p>
	This sliding scale rate sheet is inspired by <a href="http://aorta.coop/rates/">Aorta</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eiT7EbIf300i_iTJtfzi7aoXUuvSj9hXJVWNG-NRiuo/edit">generative somatics</a>. I am very open to negotiating pricing based on budget constraints, <a href="http://www.lawrencebarrinerii.com/vision" target="_blank">values alignment</a>, opportunities for future work, travel to places I've never been (!!!), and more. 
</p>
<p>My day rate includes 8 hours of delivery and up to 8 hours of prep + follow up work. The day rate doesn't include travel/transportation or lodging costs. Depending on the distance and complexity of travel from Boston, I may or may not request an additional 1/4 to 1/2 day travel fee (this is a single fee for both ends of a trip).</p>

		<!-- <h3>January 2019</h3> -->
		<blockquote>I just wanted to thank you for being such a dynamic and thoughtful leader for us this week. As you know, I had deep anxiety and I am not only relieved but excited about what is to come. You created a safe space that I was unsure was possible -- one where we could all connect and be honest and display vulnerability and learn from each other. Thank you.</blockquote>
		– 2019 Leadership team retreat

		<blockquote>I also wanted to mention, that I think you did an excellent job managing the situation that came up at the end of the workshop.  It was a very difficult situation but you handled it beautifully.  With assertiveness, respect, honesty and kindness.</blockquote>
