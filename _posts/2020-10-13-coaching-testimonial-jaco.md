Lawrence is a special mix of enormous heart (e.g. deep listening, empathy), brilliant mind (e.g. insights, connections), and connected soul (e.g. groundedness, *big* picture). What else could you want in a coach??

So much shifted when we were working together:

⁃awareness of negative self-talk
⁃ability to feel what my gut’s telling me
⁃feeling at peace about leaving work earlier / on time
⁃regularly stepping back and planning at work
⁃connection to my body
⁃self-love
