				<p>This is a back-burner project. I really like books, but I also really dislike owning too many things. One time I saw a postcard or something that had a drawing of what looked like a shelf of books. It was only the spines, but it inspired me. I looked around the internet and found these excellent posters of an entire bookshelf. And it seemed like that could be a really great way to take all my books with me (say were I to have an office someday) and put them on my wall or door without actually bringing all my books. Here are a few examples of inspiration: <a href="">Example 1</a>, <a href="">Example 2</a>.</p>
				<p>Anywhere, right now I'm just starting with the book covers auto-generated from my book lists on goodreads. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bgolder">Ben Golder</a> heavily supported me in building this during the summer of 2017. Definitely a work in progress.</p>
