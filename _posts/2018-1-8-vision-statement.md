## Extended Vision

In the future (2041):

I will be known in my community as **loving**, **supportive**, **strategic**, and **visionary**. In my work towards justice for the planet and people, the legacy of my work in my community will show that I am loving and [care deeply about supporting others](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-2). That support will be visible from the micro (1on1) to the macro (facilitation of large groups). I will be trusted as someone who can think critically and move effectively towards systemic goals in systems of all sizes. I will be known as someone who creates space for vision (the visions of others as well as my own) by being aligned with myself and the truest self of others.

My community will be **diverse**, **interdependent**, and **creative**. My community will have many different types of people (ability, race, gender, class, culture, age, location, etc.) who understand and lean into their inextricable connectedness while also holding their own unique differences and wholenesses. Our interdependence on each other and the broader non-human world is one of the sources of our creativity. This creativity (as well as love for each other) must be harnessed to keep us moving towards a better world that also supports us to be more human humans.   

The planet and places humans live will be **resilient**, **free**, and hold both **chaos** and **order**. Life will be understood as change. Ecosystems at all scales will have enough complexity and biodiversity to handle significant shocks while continuing their capacities to carry life. But not just any life; non-self-terminating life, life that is increasingly able to experience liberation, freedom.<sup>1</sup> Humans will learn to recognize, accept, and align with the reality that all successful life is a perpetual dance of chaos and order.<sup>2</sup>

1. My personal definition of liberation: joy untouched by fear. Drawing on the words of Nina Simone via “Freedom Is a Feeeling! Freedom Is No Fear!” – Nina Simone – New York, 1968, 2016. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD8f2m8WGI>.
2. “But it is also a world that seeks order. When chaos erupts, it not only destroys the current structure, it also creates the conditions for new order to emerge. Change always involves a dark night when everything falls apart. Yet if this period of dissolution is used to create new meaning, then chaos ends and new order emerges.” Margaret Wheatley.
