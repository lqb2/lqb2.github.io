In 2024 my work will be focused in two areas. 

<br>

(1) **Liberation**. This includes but is not limited to: 

- liberatory coaching, and 
- facilitating retreats, workshops, and trainings related to liberation 
- supporting liberatory leaders or capacity building for people wanting to practice liberatory leadership


(2) **Land justice and environmental justice**. This includes (but is not limited to) work related to or support orgs that do:

* land rematriation, 
* land justice, 
* farming, and 
* environmental justice

**My dream projects in 2024** are designing and facilitating multi-day staff retreats for BIPOC or BIPOC-led organizations with a focus on environmental justice.

It is possible I will take on work projects outside of these focus areas but the likelihood is very low.
