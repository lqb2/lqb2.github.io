Lawrence is a special mix of enormous heart (e.g. deep listening, empathy), brilliant mind (e.g. insights, connections), and connected soul (e.g. groundedness, *big* picture). What else could you want in a coach??

So much shifted when we were working together:

* awareness of negative self-talk
* ability to feel what my gut’s telling me
* feeling at peace about leaving work earlier / on time
* regularly stepping back and planning at work
* connection to my body
* self-love
