### What do I appreciate about Lawrence as a coach?



Lawrence is the first professional I have worked with, whom have made me feel safe enough to share myself all the way through. He masters the fine balance of sharing himself to ensure a safe space, while keeping it professional and the focus on you. He is amazing at feeling what is needed it the moment, while directing me forward, towards my goals.
