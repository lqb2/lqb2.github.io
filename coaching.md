> "A great coach tells you what you need to hear not what you want to hear." — Sagi Kalev

I offer both life coaching and professional coaching services. My life coaching practice almost always begins with a 3-session [intro package](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkkuWMfPaB0wcUFwisYbj-znRdkJl2mBFIUpMMeefSU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. Sessions can be added ad-hoc or in sets of three. I typically book calls 6 weeks in advance. You can see my sliding scale rate sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxujZckhY8eIfNRIc_MlCGRGsrQ9t5slfItcBJCF92w/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

I offer professional coaching for organizations or single departments through employers via retainer, using my [sliding scale consulting rates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0WiPZ8srwWC6SZrD9qVsmDTNQ4gW6YWbDw4tammFU8/edit){:target="_blank"}. If you are an individual and need professional coaching or you are an employer looking for something other than a retainer, please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact) and let's see what's possible.

## Testimonials



> Lawrence has had a transformative effect on my life in the past few years... Life-coaching is at times an inadequate term for what this process looks like... And the remarkable thing has been that when we have set intentions, goals, and done these visioning exercises... usually within a year of me articulating an intention, my life transforms in such a manner that those intentions are realized. — [Huma G.]({{ site.baseurl}}events/2020/10/11/coaching-testimonial-huma.html)



> Lawrence is a special mix of enormous heart (e.g. deep listening, empathy), brilliant mind (e.g. insights, connections), and connected soul (e.g. groundedness, *big* picture). What else could you want in a coach??<br>
— [Jaco Cohen]({{ site.baseurl}}events/2020/10/13/coaching-testimonial-jaco.html)

> I appreciate Lawrence’s active listening and deep engagement with what I expressed as my goals, struggles, and challenges. While his practice had its own shape, it felt very much like Lawrence adapted his coaching practice to the goals that I wanted to achieve, the problems I identified, and the shifts I wanted to make (and learned that I wanted to make through coaching!)...
