## what this is

hello three lovely humans!

i made this page just for yall. it's meant to a landing page for the duration of this habit-building exercise. what we do with it afterwards we can figure out later (which might just be deleting it).

anywho, one of you has made a request to know who else is in this trio so could you each email me something like three sentences saying a little about yourself and why you're trying to build your public writing muscles? i'll share all three at the same time assuming you're each willing to share. if anyone is not, then the request just won't be granted. ^_^

## tracking

[here's the spreadsheet i made for us to track our habits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T2eOefpcQcxDYPir-f7UMtdAUmpdEwD0dkC7l-HQtZY/edit#gid=0). i'll be partcipating too but building a different habit. 

## pick a right-sized commitment!

one place where lots of people hit a wall in trying to build new habits is trying to do everything at once. it's like "i want to run a marathon eventually so i should be trying to run 10 miles a day... starting tomorrow." 

lots of good thinking on habits shows that the best way to build a habit is to break it up into two pieces. the first piece is just building the habit into your life. the second piece is then using the now-built habit to move towards the goal. the important part about the first piece is that _it is not intended to show you measurable results towards your goal._ 

so. between now and monday, which is when we'll begin, pick a writing habit that feels like the appropriate size. i suggest starting with literally one sentence (see reference #2). if that feels too small, start with it for 2-3 days anyways and *then* you can increase it. but the feeling of success/victory matters more than you think. particularly because the feeling of a small win is much better and builds more momentum and confidence than a loss of any size. 

ok, that's enough for now. please send me sentences about yourselves so i can share them here. 


## who you are

## inspirations

these are examples of some folks who do some sort of writing daily or inspiration material to help you see why this is such an important practice to build!
