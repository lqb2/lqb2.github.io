### Facilitation 

> To facilitate means 'to make easier.' — adrienne maree brown


In my definition, facilitation is the work of making it easier for a person or group to move towards a desired goal. My [life/productivity coaching](https://lqb2.github.io/productivity/coaching.html) is faciltiation at the scale of the individual. Some of my social media work related to public engagement (ex: running communications for [GoBoston2030](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/go-boston-2030)) is facilitation at the largest scale. I am happy anywhere in between and I strongly prefer in-person, multicultural, and justice-oriented gatherings. 

I have been trained by the [Interaction Institute for Social Change](http://interactioninstitute.org) in [Facilitative Leadership](http://interactioninstitute.org/training/facilitative-leadership-for-social-change/) and the [Fundamentals of Facilitation for Racial Justice Work](http://interactioninstitute.org/training/fundamentals-of-facilitation-for-racial-justice-work/), by [Interaction Associates]() as a [Masterful Trainer](http://interactionassociates.com/training/masterful-trainer) and as a [Manager](http://interactionassociates.com/training/managing-impact), by [adrienne maree brown](http://adriennemareebrown.net/) in [emergent strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html) facilitation. Some of my 2018 clients include [Grist.org](https://grist.org/) and the [Multicultural Teaching Institute](http://www.multiculturalteaching.org/). Upcoming work in 2019 includes a workshop for a Boston College freshman energy seminar on having difficult conversations and facilitating at the Center for Story-Based Strategy's [Advanced Practitioner Training](https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/the-advanced-training/).
