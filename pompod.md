community infrastructure to get shit done! we use [the pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFW3Ld7JO0w) + and connect with each other for joy, commiseration, and collective accountability. pompod is an evolution of the [gsd during covid-19](http://lqb2.co/blog///2020/03/16/gsd-during-covid-19-pomodoros/) practice.


use the text thread to let people know when you'll be on. join the meeting room. 


the first 5 mins of each half hour is for checking in and listing out what you'll be working on. the next 25 mins is for focused workflow. rinse. wash. repeat.
