<!-- ## Bio  -->

Lawrence Barriner II, here. 

I believe in the power of love to create justice and the power of story to make new worlds possible. I imagine radical alternatives to our existing reality not as an escape but as a strategy. I dream of a world where liberation is experienced, not just imagined. My work in building that world is to support transformation at all scales. 

At the scale of the individual, I support transformation through 1on1 (life and/or productivity) coaching. At the organizational scale, I facilitate as a means to support groups of people to move through or transform in relationship to barriers. At the network scale, I support ecosystem transformation by supporting people to think about what it means to move like a network and then act accordingly. 

I have a Master of City Planning and Bachelor of Science in Planning, both from MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. My research while at MIT primarily focused on food systems and food justice. Teaching (and doing) photography scratched my creative itches. 

My paid work is primarily strategic communications, storytelling, teaching, and facilitation. I do these as a staff person, as a consultant, and sometimes both. 

I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, and have lived in Boston since the Fall of 2007 (save two gap years in the middle of undergrad when I almost became a monk). I run a consulting practice, [a blog](http://lqb2.co/blog/), a [weekly newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/lqb2), a [bi-weekly radio show](http://postpatriarchalradio.tumblr.com), and a [completely irregular podcast](https://soundcloud.com/lawrence-barriner-ii/sets/the-intersectional-enneagram). 

My vision of the world has people living in right relationship with each other, the planet, and all beings (human and non). I am a proud gay uncle to the children of several friends and know Iâ€™m moving at the right pace when I am baking sourdough at least once a week.


<!-- Lawrence is a communications strategist, connector, and systems thinker. He loves quotes, facilitating, baking bread, feeding his worms, and cooking/eating good food with good friends.

His previous work includes communications, food systems & food justice research and consulting, web design, and graphic design. He plays a lot of [volleyball](http://www.cbvolleyball.net/pages/aboutus), keeps busy with [way too many side projects](https://lqb2.github.io/now/), [tries to write daily](https://lqb2.github.io/blog/), and [has a weekly newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/lqb2). He has an undergraduate and graduate degree, both in City Planning, from MIT and is working towards a world that supports  people to imagine and achieve better, more whole futures for themselves and their loved ones. -->
