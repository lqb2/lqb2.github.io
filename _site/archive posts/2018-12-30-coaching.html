<h2 id="content">Intro Package (3 sessions)</h2>
<p>
    Each session is 90 minutes and can be in person or by phone. The average amount of time between each session is about 4 weeks but you can have more or less time depending on your needs.
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>1: Scratching the surface</h3>
        <p>This session is largely about surfacing your current reality. I'll ask lots of questions and you'll do lots of talking. I'll ask you things about how your day-to-day life and where (and how) you want to be in the future. In the process, I'll share a little bit about what I see and we'll identify a 1-3 areas to work on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>2: Digging in</h3>
        <p>After having some time (2-8 weeks) to run with those areas we picked out, we'll check in about how things went! Based on that and things I heard in the first session, I'll share more tips, tools, and theory about how to work towards personal change. We'll tweak your list of experiments and then set our sights on session 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>3: Learning from experiments</h3>
        <p>In this session, we'll review how the 2nd round of experiments went. Then, having done two loops of experimentation, we'll reflect on how you **actually** change (or don't!). After thinking through that, we'll brainstorm how to incorporate those lessons to support other changes you want to make. I'll also ask you for a little feedback on the whole process.</p>

        <h3>Tune up / Check in</h3>
        <p>If you've done the Intro package, we can do a 60 minute tune up/check in at any time (schedules allowing, of course). These are helpful if you want a medium amount of support figuring out how to work through a specific block or barrier in your change processes.</p>

        <h3>Personal Systems Consult</h3>
        <p>If we've never worked together before, but you're not interested in the Intro package, this could be for you. In a single 2-hour session, I'll assess how your personal systems work and how you think about them. Then I'll share a bunch of relevant theory, tips, and tools. I'll also put together a list of resources for you to dig into.</p>
        <ul class="actions">

<p>These are offerings that I'm starting to experiment with. Until I get them fine tuned, pricing is negotiable. Help me help other folks (and yourself) by trying these out with me!</p> -->

        <h3>Annual Retreat</h3>
        <p>Each year for the past several years, I've gone on <a href="https://lqb2.github.io/blog/2016/12/23/my-personal-retreat-long-version/">an annual retreat</a> to prep for the next year. In 2020, Maureen White and I launched <a href="https://www.2020vision.space/">2020 vision</a>: a retreat that supported 10 folks to vision for their year. Sign up for the mailing list there to get notified if we decide to offer it again.</p>

        <h3>Cohort Coaching</h3>
        <p>Interested in the Intro Package but want to come with a buddy (or 2 or 3)? I'm testing out how to support groups of 2-4 people to go through a series of 3 sessions together. There will be less attention on each individual, but having a built-in support structure and other people to learn with/from can be worth the tradeoff.</p>
        <p>H/T to DCC at <a href="http://infinitegrowth.rocks/">Infinite Growth</a> for this cohort idea.</p>
        <ul class="actions">
            <li><span class="button special disabled">$150-450 / session</span></li>

<h2 id="content">A Note about Pricing</h2>
<p>I'm also committed to getting compensated what I think the work is worth and I'm really interested in making this work available to everyone. Therefore, I offer coaching using a sliding scale <i>and</i> I love bartering. I am especially excited to barter outputs that come up in the process of the coaching itself... For example, one person I worked with wanted to do more pottery. I helped them restructure their time and energy to spend more time on pottery. Instead of cash, they gave me pots. Not only did they spend more time on pottery, but I got some dope pots that I am still using today and they are more confident about their pottery! I love working out arrangements like this. Partial trades are on the table, too. I take payment in cash, via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/lqb2" target="new">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://venmo.com/lawrence-barrinerii" target="_blank">Venmo</a> , and am happy to structure whatever payment plan works for you.</p>
