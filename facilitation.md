		<p>Hi! I'm excited you're interested in working with me. Below are my pricing guidelines along with a bit of extra info and some words from recent clients. Please check this out and then let's get on the phone (or video is even better!) and see if I can support you or your organization in your work.

<h2 id="content">Pricing</h2>
<p>
	This sliding rate sheet is inspired by <a href="http://aorta.coop/rates/">Aorta</a>. I am very open to negotiating pricing based on budget constraints, <a href="http://www.lawrencebarrinerii.com/vision" target="_blank">values alignment</a>, opportunities for future work, travel to places I've never been (!!!), and more.

		<h3>Solidarity Rate</h3>
		<ul class="actions">
			<li><span class="button special disabled">$0-2,400</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>For organizations with annual budgets up to $400,000</i></p>
		<p>This rate is for organizations that are small, just starting out, or intentionally choosing to limit their budget and staff for strategic reasons.</p>

			<li><span class="button special">$2,400-3,600</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p><i>For organizations with annual budgets between $400,000 and $2 million</i></p>
		<p>This rate is calculated based on my cost of living and allows me to invest in myself and my communities so we leave behind a better world for our children. </p>

		<!-- <h3>January 2019</h3> -->
		<blockquote>I just wanted to thank you for being such a dynamic and thoughtful leader for us this week. As you know, I had deep anxiety and I am not only relieved but excited about what is to come. You created a safe space that I was unsure was possible -- one where we could all connect and be honest and display vulnerability and learn from each other. Thank you.</blockquote>
		– 2019 Leadership team retreat
		<hr> 
		<blockquote>I also wanted to mention, that I think you did an excellent job managing the situation that came up at the end of the workshop.  It was a very difficult situation but you handled it beautifully.  With assertiveness, respect, honesty and kindness.</blockquote>
