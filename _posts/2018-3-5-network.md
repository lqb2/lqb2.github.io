you can email me at lqb [at] alum [dot] mit [dot] edu. you can find me on most social media platforms using @lqb2 (including [twitter](https://twitter.com/lqb2) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lqb2/)). i'm also on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lqbii) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawrencebarrinerii/). if you want to schedule a meeting with me, feel free to try finding something on my [calendly](https://calendly.com/lqb2) or we can do it the old-fashioned way and you just can email me.

you can also get in touch with any of my favorite collaborators below. shout out to [danya sherman](https://www.danyasherman.com/) for our session where this crystallized into a thought i should implement for my own site.
