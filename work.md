## Work

I primarily work in the domains of communications and facilitation and I am happiest engaging projects that exist at their intersection. 

### Facilitation 

> To facilitate means 'to make easier.' — adrienne maree brown


In my definition, facilitation is the work of making it easier for a person or group to move towards a desired goal. My [life/productivity coaching](https://lqb2.github.io/productivity/coaching.html) is faciltiation at the scale of the individual. Some of my social media work related to public engagement (ex: running communications for [GoBoston2030](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/go-boston-2030)) is facilitation at the largest scale. I am happy anywhere in between and I strongly prefer in-person, multicultural, and justice-oriented gatherings. 

I have been trained by the [Interaction Institute for Social Change](http://interactioninstitute.org) in [Facilitative Leadership](http://interactioninstitute.org/training/facilitative-leadership-for-social-change/) and the [Fundamentals of Facilitation for Racial Justice Work](http://interactioninstitute.org/training/fundamentals-of-facilitation-for-racial-justice-work/), by [Interaction Associates]() as a [Masterful Trainer](http://interactionassociates.com/training/masterful-trainer) and as a [Manager](http://interactionassociates.com/training/managing-impact), by [adrienne maree brown](http://adriennemareebrown.net/) in [emergent strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html) facilitation. Some of my 2018 clients include [Grist.org](https://grist.org/) and the [Multicultural Teaching Institute](http://www.multiculturalteaching.org/). Upcoming work in 2019 includes a workshop for a Boston College freshman energy seminar on having difficult conversations and facilitating at the Center for Story-Based Strategy's [Advanced Practitioner Training](https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/the-advanced-training/).

### Communications

As a communications strategist, I deeply believe that shifting story can make new worlds possible and impossible. My communications work started in video and photography and has evolved to include web design, graphic design, social media, and, most recently, narrative strategy and strategic communications by the [Center for Story-Based Strategy](https://www.storybasedstrategy.org/). Recent communications clients include: the [MIT Community Innovators Lab](https://colab.mit.edu) and [Californians for Justice](http://caljustice.org/)  

**Testimonials**

* “do you know what what i get the most out of our talks? listening. which is funny because i talk a LOT during our chats… but i find that you’re one of the best listeners that i know and then *i* listen better when i’m talking to other people. it’s great.” — [spencer wilson](http://spewil.github.io/about/)
* "I just wanted to say thanks, and to let you know I've turned into a (now not so) secret admirer.  I clicked through to your blog from facebook, and you are an incredible writer and thinker.  (The two definitely go hand in hand but are equally challenging in their own ways.) If you don't mind, I'm going to hang around for the inspiration and the motivation." - Craig Aubuchon 
* “My goal is to establish a regular writing practice this month, that I can maintain over time, so I can be more prolific and rad. Like you. ;)” — [Angus Maguire](http://beclouded.net/)
