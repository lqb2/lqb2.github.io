<blockquote>
  <p>To facilitate means ‘to make easier.’ — adrienne maree brown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my definition, facilitation is the work of making it easier for a person or group to move towards a desired goal. My <a href="https://lqb2.github.io/productivity/coaching.html">life/productivity coaching</a> is faciltiation at the scale of the individual. Some of my social media work related to public engagement (ex: running communications for <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/go-boston-2030">GoBoston2030</a>) is facilitation at the largest scale. I am happy anywhere in between and I strongly prefer in-person, multicultural, and justice-oriented gatherings.</p>

<p>I have been trained by the <a href="http://interactioninstitute.org">Interaction Institute for Social Change</a> in <a href="http://interactioninstitute.org/training/facilitative-leadership-for-social-change/">Facilitative Leadership</a> and the <a href="http://interactioninstitute.org/training/fundamentals-of-facilitation-for-racial-justice-work/">Fundamentals of Facilitation for Racial Justice Work</a>, by <a href="">Interaction Associates</a> as a <a href="http://interactionassociates.com/training/masterful-trainer">Masterful Trainer</a> and as a <a href="http://interactionassociates.com/training/managing-impact">Manager</a>, by <a href="http://adriennemareebrown.net/">adrienne maree brown</a> in <a href="https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html">emergent strategy</a> facilitation.

<p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“do you know what i get the most out of our talks? listening. which is funny because i talk a LOT during our chats… but i find that you’re one of the best listeners that i know and then <em>i</em> listen better when i’m talking to other people. it’s great.” — <a href="http://spewil.github.io/about/">spencer wilson</a></li>
  <li>“I just wanted to say thanks, and to let you know I’ve turned into a (now not so) secret admirer.  I clicked through to your blog from facebook, and you are an incredible writer and thinker.  (The two definitely go hand in hand but are equally challenging in their own ways.) If you don’t mind, I’m going to hang around for the inspiration and the motivation.” - Craig Aubuchon</li>
  <li>“My goal is to establish a regular writing practice this month, that I can maintain over time, so I can be more prolific and rad. Like you. ;)” — <a href="http://beclouded.net/">Angus Maguire</a></li>

<h2 id="content">Intro Package (3 sessions)</h2>
<p>
    Each session is 90-120 minutes and can be in person, by phone, or by video. The average amount of time between each session is about 4 weeks.
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>1: Scratching the surface</h3>
        <p>This session is largely about surfacing your current reality. I'll ask lots of questions and you'll do lots of talking. I'll ask you things about how your day-to-day life and where (and how) you want to be in the future. In the process, I'll share a little bit about what I see and we'll identify a 1-3 areas to work on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>2: Digging in</h3>
        <p>After having some time (2-8 weeks) to run with those areas we picked out, we'll check in about how things went! Based on that and things I heard in the first session, I'll share more tips, tools, and theory about how to work towards personal change. We'll tweak your list of experiments and then set our sights on session 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>3: Learning from experiments</h3>
        <p>In this session, we'll review how the 2nd round of experiments went. Then, having done two loops of experimentation, we'll reflect on how you **actually** change (or don't!). After thinking through that, we'll brainstorm how to incorporate those lessons to support other changes you want to make. I'll also ask you for a little feedback on the whole process.</p>
    </div>

<h2 id="content">Other Offerings</h2>
<!-- <p></p> -->

<div class="row">
    <div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        <h3>Tune up / Check in</h3>
        <p>If you've done the Intro package, we can do a 60 minute tune up/check in at any time (schedules allowing, of course). These are helpful if you want a medium amount of support figuring out how to work through a specific block or barrier in your change processes.</p>
        <ul class="actions">
            <li><span class="button special disabled">$80</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        <h3>Personal Systems Consult</h3>
        <p>If we've never worked together before, but you're not interested in the Intro package, this could be for you. In a single 2-hour session, I'll assess how your personal systems work and how you think about them. Then I'll share a bunch of relevant theory, tips, and tools. I'll also put together a list of resources for you to dig into.</p>
        <ul class="actions">

<h2 id="elements">Experimental Offerings</h2>
<p>These are offerings that I'm starting to experiment with. Until I get them fine tuned, pricing is negotiable. Help me help other folks (and yourself) by trying these out with me!</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>Annual Retreat</h3>
        <p>Each year for the past couple of years, I've gone on <a href="https://lqb2.github.io/blog/2016/12/23/my-personal-retreat-long-version/">an annual retreat</a> to prep for the next year. In 2018 (assuming we make it that far), I'll be taking 2-3 days between January 1st and 8th to travel somewhere close to Boston, get a quiet house (hopefully with a wood stove), and go through my whole reflection process. If you're interested in coming along, let's talk! I'm happy to support you through my process or you can just come along and do your own thing.</p>
        <ul class="actions">
            <li><span class="button special disabled">Who Knows...</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>  
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
        <h3>Cohort Coaching</h3>
        <p>Interested in the Intro Package but want to come with a buddy (or 2 or 3)? I'm testing out how to support groups of 2-4 people to go through a series of 3 sessions together. There's less attention on each individual, but having a built-in support structure and other people to learn with/from can be worth the tradeoff.</p>
        <p>H/T to DCC at <a href="http://infinitegrowth.rocks/">Infinite Growth</a> for this cohort idea.</p>
        <ul class="actions">
            <li><span class="button special disabled">$300-600</span></li>
        </ul>

</div>

<hr class="major" />

<h2 id="content">A Note about Pricing</h2>
<p>I'm really interested in making this work available to everyone. I'm also committed to getting compensated what I think the work is worth. So that said, I'm happy to talk and figure out how to make it work. I love bartering and am especially excited to barter outputs that come up in the process.</p>
<p>For example, one person I worked with wanted to do more pottery. So one of their experiments was to set aside specific blocks time for making pottery. In the end, instead of money, they gave me some of the work they produced. Not only was the output a driver of spending the time on the pottery, it also made them more confident about their pottery!</p>
<p>I love working out arrangements like this. Partial trades are on the table, too. I take payment in cash, via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/lqb2" target="new">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://venmo.com/lawrence-barrinerii" target="_blank">Venmo</a> , and am happy to structure whatever payment plan works for you.</p>

<p>In the future (2041):</p>

<p>I will be known in my community as <strong>loving</strong>, <strong>supportive</strong>, <strong>strategic</strong>, and <strong>visionary</strong>. In my work towards justice for the planet and people, the legacy of my work in my community will show that I am loving<sup>1</sup> and <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-2">care deeply about supporting others</a>. That support will be visible from the micro (1on1) to the macro (facilitation of large groups). I will be trusted as someone who thinks critically and moves effectively towards systemic goals in systems of all sizes. I will be known as someone who creates space for vision (the visions of others as well as my own) by being aligned with myself and inspiring others to be aligned with their truest selves.</p>

<p>My community will be <strong>diverse</strong>, <strong>interdependent</strong>, and <strong>creative</strong>. My community will have many different types of people (ability, race, gender, class, culture, age, location, etc.) who understand that our unique differences and wholenesses make our inextricable connectedness feel like a joyful magic. Our interdependence on each other and the broader more-than-human world will be a source of our creativity. We will harness this creativity (as well as love) to move towards a world in which we understand what it means to be human and how our gift as a species creates a responsibility which we are bound to fulfill. Our presence on the planet will improve life for all beings.</p>

<p>The planet and places humans live will be <strong>resilient</strong>, <strong>free</strong>, and hold both <strong>chaos</strong> and <strong>order</strong>. Life will be understood as change and our species will know when to hold on and when to let go. Ecosystems at all scales (including the ones humans create and modify) will have the complexity and biodiversity to handle shocks while continuing their capacities to carry life. But not just any life; non-self-terminating life, life that is increasingly able to experience liberation<sup>2</sup> and freedom.<sup>3</sup> Humans will recognize, accept, and align with the reality that all successful life is a perpetual dance of chaos and order.<sup>4</sup></p>

  <li>My definition of love: “The will and action to nurture the growth of yourself or someone else.” It’s a modified version of the one bell hooks borrows from M. Scott Peck. I also think the follow statement, from hooks’ book, Communion: The Female Search for Love, expands love into its elements and is super useful: “Love is a combination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect and trust.”</li>
  <li>“Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit myself to - what is best for me.” Paulo Coelho. The Zahir.</li>
  <li>My personal definition of liberation: joy untouched by fear. Drawing on the words of Nina Simone via “Freedom Is a Feeeling! Freedom Is No Fear!” – Nina Simone – New York, 1968, 2016. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD8f2m8WGI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD8f2m8WGI</a>.</li>
  <li>“But it is also a world that seeks order. When chaos erupts, it not only destroys the current structure, it also creates the conditions for new order to emerge. Change always involves a dark night when everything falls apart. Yet if this period of dissolution is used to create new meaning, then chaos ends and new order emerges.” Margaret Wheatley. <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html">Leadership Lessons for The Real World</a>. 2006. <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html">http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html</a></li>

<p>Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.tararoberts.me/about">Tara Roberts</a>. I am looking for something under $1k per month (ideally) and in walking distance of MIT. And I’ll be there from Sept - December definitely. Maybe for the second semester as well. Depends on whether I can get adjusted to the cold! :) I’d love to build community with a few roommates that respect and honor space for creative expression and thoughtful conversations. It would also be great to have a private bath. I know that’s asking a lot, but you never know!</p>

<p>Alternatively, I might have an opportunity to move with another woman who will be running a new VR lab at MIT.  A cozy 2-bedroom, furnished, also within walking distance of MIT for $2500 or less, would also be of interest to us both.</p>

<p>Hi friends,</p>

<p>I am in the process of looking for housing in Field’s Corner. Over the past few years and especially the past year, yoga practice has become increasingly a foundation for my life. I’ve been going steadily to JP Centre, but at some level it always leaves me with the ickiness of white supremacy.</p>

<p>And so, I’m looking for a place near 4 corners yoga studio. I recently came across this posting: https://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/nfb/d/boston-large-newly-renovated-4bed-2bath/6872550751.html. I’m also open to taking an open room in another apt. Timeline flexible.</p>

<p>I’d love to live with other self-aware, emotionally intelligent people who have some kind of community values/orientation.</p>

<p>If you could forward along to people you know who may be interested, I’d appreciate it. I can be reached out to via e-mail or via text at 401-451-7736.</p>

<p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>Hope you’re enjoying a lovely long weekend!</p>

<p>Eli and I are looking for a place to live and given the craziness of the market here we’d so appreciate your help! </p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any hot tips on apartments in your building or neighborhood, a broker or landlord you like that might know of places, etc etc.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a non-luxury situation, lease starting 9/1, 1-2 bedrooms (I work from home), and nice light. We’re more familiar with Cambridge / Somerville but are open to other locations. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any info you have. </p>

<h2 id="1br1ba-on-clinton-st-in-cambridge-1800"><del>1br/1ba on Clinton st in Cambridge ($1800)</del></h2>

<p>Hey folks!</p>

<p>Cole and I have lived for five happy years in a very large floor-through 1br/1ba on Clinton st in Cambridge (central square, 2 blocks north of city hall).</p>

<p>We had a baby last August and are moving into a two bedroom either in mid June or early July- we’re hoping to find someone to take the last 4-6 weeks of our lease. Can you folks forward this along to anyone who might be looking for housing soon?</p>

<h3 id="about-the-unit">About the unit:</h3>

<p>The rent is $1800 and includes heat and hot water.</p>

<h4 id="upsides">Upsides:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Landlords live on the first floor and are super friendly, (we sometimes go over for coffee or a glass of wine) and very attentive. If there’s a problem, the issue is literally dealt with within 24 hours of us letting them know.</li>
  <li>Over the almost five years we’ve lived here, they only raised the rent once ($50) and generally like to keep the rent low and stable for good tenants.</li>
  <li>It’s a small building, an older couple lives on the second floor (they’ve lived here for decades) and are friendly- though they are loud during the Superbowl.</li>
  <li>The unit is on the top floor so it’s very quiet.</li>
  <li>The bedroom is huge, as in you could probably fit 7 or 8 queen sized mattresses in just the bedroom.</li>
  <li>There is a beautiful American Elm tree outside the living room that provides shade in the summer and stunning yellow leaves in the fall.</li>
  <li>Landlords allow cats.</li>
  <li>There is a bike rack installed in the driveway.</li>
  <li>There is parking available for an additional fee.</li>
  <li>It’s very bright and sunny. Even in rainy weather we rarely turn on the overhead lights during the day.</li>
  <li>Electric utilities usually cost us about $35/mo. There is a new, energy efficient fridge.</li>
  <li>It’s two blocks north of city hall and three blocks north of the Central Square (red line) station.</li>
  <li>Insane amount of closet space (two walk-in closets in the living room and five closets in the bedroom.</li>
  <li>We love our neighbors SO much and have formed incredibly close relationships with them- they are awesome! The couple next door has lived in their house since the early 1950s and has become like a second set of grandparents to our daughter. Our across the street neighbor is now one of our closest family friends and we trade cat sitting services and hang out with our neighbors down the block.</li>
  <li>There’s a working, full-size portable dishwasher that we bought and are happy to leave behind because our new place has a dishwasher. It connects to the faucet but the downside is that you can’t use the sink or stove while the dishwasher is running.</li>
  <li>The unit does get warm in the summer, but the landlords include two window unit air conditioners- so you don’t need to buy one if you want AC.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="downsides">Downsides:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The sink and oven (4 burner electric) are “efficiency sized”- but we cook for almost every meal and have made it work.</li>
  <li>The living room and bedroom have recently replaced carpets that are in very good condition- I just hate carpeting because it means you have to vacuum. The kitchen and dining room have beautiful original wood floors.</li>
  <li>While we have a washing machine in unit- we bought it ourselves and are taking it with us. There is a laundry hookup in the unit, but it is unlikely that the landlords will allow you to have a machine- but you can ask- they might be open to it.</li>
  <li>The ceilings in the kitchen and living room are low- about 6’8” or 7’. My husband is 6’1” and finds it manageable. I’m 5’5” and I have no problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>We would definitely stay in this apartment and hold onto it for dear life if we didn’t think we needed a second bedroom.</p>

<h3 id="posted-6-jan-2018">Posted: 6 Jan 2018</h3>

<p>Recently-renovated, super-sunny 2-bedroom apartment right off the 3/4 Crown Heights/Utica stop available for February. This is a large, lovely apartment with an open layout and an exceptional amount of light, situated on the 4th (top) floor corner (south and west facing windows) of a ~20 unit walk-up building. There are two sinks, nice appliances, a combo washer-dryer unit, an island in the open kitchen area, and a long entryway good for storing bikes, shoes, etc. The bedrooms are slightly different sizes, but both have large closets and easily fit queen-sized beds. It’s a really beautiful spot. Rent is $2,500/mo.</p>

<p>We are looking for people to take over our lease through August 2018 (or August 2019 if preferred). We can be flexible on the specific start date in February, and we’ll help facilitate with the landlord.</p>

<h3 id="posted-24-june-2017">Posted: 24 June 2017</h3>

<p>My two roommates are moving out and I am looking for new lovely people to join me in creating a home. I thought you all might be or know some amazing people who’d be interested. </p>

<p>It’s on the corner of Spring Park Ave and Burr Street in JP just 2 blocks from Stony Brook and the center of town and the Pond. The rooms are available 9/1 and the rent will be $766 each plus utilities (gas heat, reasonable). It is first floor of a 2 floor condo. It feels like a home rather than an apartment. My landlord is incredible. She has consciously kept the rent under market to keep us there. The apartment is full of light and love.</p>

<p>There is laundry on site and no pets are allowed.</p>

<h2 id="radical-hope"><a href="">radical hope</a></h2>

<p>i felt like i had to read this book given the radical imagination work grant and i have been interested in doing lately. it’s a lovely collection of letters and  a quick read that i probably read too fast. has past, present, and future directed letters and the range of voices and letter recipients is wonderful. i should go back and find some of my favorites and mark them for future teaching materials</p>

<h2 id="bloodchild-and-other-stories"><a href="">bloodchild and other stories</a></h2>

<p>it’s pretty insane that butler can pack just as much into her short stories as she does with her novels. she does it repeatedly in this collection. the opening story, bloodchild - the title for the collection, whops a mind bending wallop and the final story, martha’s book, a story about the nature of divinity, hit me so powerfully at exactly the right moment (during the evolutionary leadership workshop at chanel rock on cortes island). butler’s ability to take the basic underlying premises of our lives, keep them, but bend them just enough to make me rethink the whole world is astounding.</p>

<h2 id="the-dispossessed"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6602919-the-dispossessed">the dispossessed</a></h2>

<p>this book. just. wow. i saw another review somewhere that said this line (which i fully agree with): “this book is philosophy disguised as sci-fi.” it starts out slow, but it’s all brilliantly planned. i love how elements that seem totally mundane and useless come back around as plot points or in the conversations of characters later on.</p>

<p>the book to me felt like a deep exploration of human societal structures and the lengths to which we can go to build systems and societies that still don’t allow us to be ourselves. because maybe it’s not possible to have a static society that can ever contain in equilibrium all that is humanity. the setting is two somewhat mirror planets where one is capitalist and patriarchal and the other is anarchist. i haven’t even fully disgested the depths to which this book shook up my thinking about societal structures so i hope to re-read it and think through it more completely.</p>

<p>my favorite thing about the book was the sections about time. i’m going to quote those sections extensively once i get them all typed up.</p>

<p>if you haven’t yet read the book, here’s a pro-tip i wish i’d had before starting: read the wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed#Plot_summary">plot summary</a> before starting. maybe i could’ve figured out what was happening but i didn’t until the very end. it would have saved me much head/heartache.</p>

<h2 id="killing-and-dying-stories"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848562-killing-and-dying">killing and dying: stories</a></h2>

<p>this is an excellent little graphic novel that has six bizarre stories about the often hidden complexity of life. each story, unfathomable to me as real, surfaces dynamics, thoughts, and specific situations as the <em>most</em> real. i don’t even know if i would classify this book as fiction or nonfiction, but regardless of where it falls, it is full of life lessons.</p>

<p>the illustrations are spare, sparse even, and convey oh so much with oh so little. i think this illustration style could be fairly described as poetry.</p>

<h2 id="harriet-tubman-conductor-on-the-underground-railroad"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183211.Harriet_Tubman">harriet tubman: conductor on the underground railroad</a></h2>

<p>i am embarrassed that i knew so little about harriet tubman’s life before reading this book. it felt like it was written for young adults and it was so so good. the author, ann petry, walked a line between poetry and honest brutality. she doesn’t shy away from the hard moments (beatings, whippings) but she paints them with a broad enough brush so the reader can fill in the violence with as little or as much as she knows. the chapters are divided really nicely into different life segments and when strung together, they give an incredible arc to an incredible woman’s life.</p>

<p>also each chapter ends with a section that is about what else is happening in history. it adds a nice layer of contex given that the book could easily be just about the amazingness that is araminta ross (harriet tubman’s birth name).</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-a-gadget"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget">you are not a gadget</a></h2>

<p>this was a profoundly strange and mindblowing book for me. reading it felt like lanier skipped a stone across a pond of time and each chapter was a weird, iridescent splash. the big points that have stuck with me from this book are:</p>

  <li>if our society holds the computer as god, we must diminish  ourselves as infinitely complex beings in order to allow the computer to render us.</li>
  <li>lock-in is a bigger problem in tech than in other spheres and industries. for example, midi is made up into bits and will never be able to capture completely the sound of a trombone glissando. and yet, midi is the foundational tech for all music in all computing. we may never know what else digital music could’ve sounded like.</li>
  <li>though it is difficult and against the grain, we should perpetually be asking ourselves: how do we shape our tools to support us to be more fully human (and not more machinelike)?</li>

<p>this is the first time i have deeply agreed with a quoted accolade on a book in a long time. “nnedi okorafor has more imagination on a single page than some other sci fi has in volumes.” this is a beautiful, quick read about a young woman who runs away from home to go to school because she is brilliant. in the process, which is complicated and fucked, she unknowingly (literally) becomes other in order to save/live her life. in the end, her ability to do that saves the lives of many others and opens up new possibilities for … the universe (i think), but she’s not totally clear (at least not by the end of the book) if its a price she was willing to pay. the book is beautifully written and so imaginative that sometimes i had to reread entire pages to make sure i was following all the revelations properly.</p>

<p>i’m super excited to read the next two books in the series.</p>

<h2 id="patternmaster">patternmaster</h2>
<p>the final book in the patternist series, it (mostly) did not disappoint. i’m so glad i read the books in chronological order (as opposed to the order in which they were written). thanks, alex kats-rubin, for that pro-tip.</p>

<p>everything in this universe now fully makes sense because i see how the details in mind of my mind and clay’s ark all cohere. this book, which is about conflict on earth between essentially alien-infected-super-human-animals and humans who have intense telepathic power, brings up all of butler’s favorite subjects. slavery, empathy, the power of the individual and the collective to shape destiny, relationship to planet, and more. this is the only butler book i’ve read so far where the protagonist is a male… must have been early in her writing career. anyway, as always, there were several moments in the reading of this book where i audibly yelped or was trembling because she writes scenes so powerfully. i <em>am</em> beginning to pick up on the gentle ways she slows down the action of a section, usually with description, right before some crazy shit happens.</p>

<p>love it. love it all. can’t wait to real all her stuff.</p>

  <p>“Love! <strong>I am excited to announce that i am going to be the new Organizing Director at Power U Center for Social Change in Miami Florida.</strong> I am Sending this message asking for your support with moving costs for this major transition. At this time I ask my community to continue to make an investment in me by giving to this fundraiser to support my move towards my longings and commitment to build a political home for Black and Brown youth.” 
— Ziquelle Smalls</p>

<p>With a family history and childhood roots in social justice organizing, Ziquelle Smalls has grown up with and has been involved in a multitude of youth organizations, and has deep roots with movement formations in Boston and beyond. Now, Ziquelle is moving to Miami, FL to become the Organizing Director at Power U Center for Social Change and <strong>needs your support in order to make this happen!</strong></p>

<p>Ziquelle is currently the Lead Organizer of Campaigns &amp; Base-Building at the <strong><a href="https://www.yjpu.org">Youth Justice and Power Union (YJPU)</a></strong> and has been part of the organization since 2013. In their role with YJPU, they have fought boldly in demanding divestment in policing, end black and brown youth criminalization, and end state violence work more largely. This effort is done through redirecting public sector funding into community solutions and other alternative work such as economic employment for young people, and more. This work has been part of a larger struggle to build community ownership and control over decisions that impact our daily lives, build collective governance for by and by communities through democratic decision making, and redistribute funds and wealth into communities most impacted by systems of oppression for transformative change.</p>

<p>Ziquelle has continued to organize for self-determining communities and build youth movement infrastructure for Black liberation work in the city of Boston. They spent the spring of their youth as an early member with <strong>Roxbury Environmental Empowerment Project (REEP)</strong> supporting the organizing efforts in building the interdependence and self-determination of Black residents in Roxbury revitalizing vacant land due to ongoing racist and classist economic disparities in 2010.</p>

<p>Ziquelle has also been heavily involved with the <strong>‘Unnamed’ Youth Organizing Group</strong> - working towards organizational survival for a multitude of youth organizations; and providing leadership pathways for Black and Brown youth to join movement building organizations, become leaders in their communities, and do effective collaborative organizing and political education work. As part of this transformative organizing collective, Ziquelle has been committed to creating a sustainable movement ecology for youth organizing and youth movements working towards black liberation.</p>

<p>In The City School’s Summer Leadership Program and its mission to develop young people to become effective leaders of social justice, Ziquelle has been a pillar in developing the political maturity and direction of its programming, and implementing larger action space to amplify the voices of queer and non-binary youth from 2012-2018. In that time, they also served as core staff and a Leadership Team member as part of the programs core governing structure and leadership advisory circle in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, Ziquelle directed the Summer Leadership Program and last year, they co-directed the program. The Summer Leadership Program consists of 85+ young people and the Director role involved coordinating key strategy partnerships, as well as supervising and coaching a staff team of 15 people.</p>

<p>For almost 10 years, Ziquelle has continued to steward a multitude of political projects, lead and implement multi-issue campaigns, and support the healing centered engagement for young people to become social justice organizers and leaders for transformative change in their communities. In their work, they have centered queer, racial, and economic justice and gender liberationist movements and so much more.</p>

<p>Ziquelle has made tremendous contributions to the youth movement in Boston, and now, <strong>as they make this transition over the next month to Miami</strong>. This is an opportunity to honor the investment Zi has made in Boston, with our own contribution to them today.</p>

<p><strong>Our goal is to raise $8,000 by February 14th, 2019</strong>, to cover costs of moving including first and last month’s rent, security deposit, essential furnishings, emergency fund, and other transition costs. If everyone can give $15-$60, I will reach my goal. You can give by clicking venmo or cashapp below.</p>

  <p>“Your contribution and support is not only helping with real moving and survival costs but ultimately creates more possibility to thrive in a new environment. I am so excited for this opportunity to build a political home for Black and Brown youth and Black women in South Florida so that they may help lead the struggle to liberate all oppressed people. 
Thank you so much in advance for your contribution. 
With gratitude for your support.” – Z</p>
