## tracking

[here's the spreadsheet i made for us to track our habits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T2eOefpcQcxDYPir-f7UMtdAUmpdEwD0dkC7l-HQtZY/edit#gid=0). i'll be partcipating too but building a different habit. 

## who you are

I spend my time in many ways but ultimately I'm striving to live the party I want to be to. 

I've been afraid to write for as long as I've felt the urge to. Over the past few years I've built a (almost) daily practice of writing morning pages. During that time I've gone from feeling like I have nothing to say to worrying about what will happen if those thoughts are shared aloud. I'm focused on two principles as I dip my toe into the well of public writing: 
* create shared practice - we learn through the work; we build connection through the learning.  I have a deep appreciation for Lawrence and my fellow learners. 
* the scar is the subject - my scars and imperfections should be studied not hidden. learning how we've healed may help understand what hurt us.

I'm a Leo, an empath, a facilitator, an aspiring parent and independent consultant living in Salem, MA. The work I've been building focuses on partnering with organizations to design values-driven work that centers imagination and vision. That said, I feel a bubbling of creative energy that I'm not sure where to place and I've been told a writing practice will help.  I want to find my words.

## what this is

hello lovely humans!

i made this page just for yall. it's meant to a landing page for the duration of this habit-building exercise. what we do with it afterwards we can figure out later (which might just be deleting it).


## pick a right-sized commitment!

one place where lots of people hit a wall in trying to build new habits is trying to do everything at once. it's like "i want to run a marathon eventually so i should be trying to run 10 miles a day... starting tomorrow." 

lots of good thinking on habits shows that the best way to build a habit is to break it up into two pieces. the first piece is just building the habit into your life. the second piece is then using the now-built habit to move towards the goal. the important part about the first piece is that _it is not intended to show you measurable results towards your goal._ 

so. between now and monday, which is when we'll begin, pick a writing habit that feels like the appropriate size. i suggest starting with literally one sentence (see reference #2). if that feels too small, start with it for 2-3 days anyways and *then* you can increase it. but the feeling of success/victory matters more than you think. particularly because the feeling of a small win is much better and builds more momentum and confidence than a loss of any size. 

ok, that's enough for now. please send me sentences about yourselves so i can share them here.
