## 2024

“Lawrence is so talented at deep listening. Every session, I was amazed by how they could listen to what I presented and then respond in a way that dug right to the root of a thought, or lovingly interrogate an underlying assumption I never realized I had. Lawrence helped me understand myself better by reflecting myself back to me with a lot of clarity, care, and integrity.”
