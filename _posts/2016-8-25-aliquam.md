## Crown Heights 2 bdrm available February ($2500)

### Posted: 6 Jan 2018

Recently-renovated, super-sunny 2-bedroom apartment right off the 3/4 Crown Heights/Utica stop available for February. This is a large, lovely apartment with an open layout and an exceptional amount of light, situated on the 4th (top) floor corner (south and west facing windows) of a ~20 unit walk-up building. There are two sinks, nice appliances, a combo washer-dryer unit, an island in the open kitchen area, and a long entryway good for storing bikes, shoes, etc. The bedrooms are slightly different sizes, but both have large closets and easily fit queen-sized beds. It's a really beautiful spot. Rent is $2,500/mo.

We are looking for people to take over our lease through August 2018 (or August 2019 if preferred). We can be flexible on the specific start date in February, and we'll help facilitate with the landlord.

Photos below, and [get in touch with me directly](annemariegray@gmail.com) if you are interested.

## Spring Park Ave and Burr Street in JP (2 bedrooms open, $766 each)

### Posted: 24 June 2017

My two roommates are moving out and I am looking for new lovely people to join me in creating a home. I thought you all might be or know some amazing people who'd be interested.Â 

It's on the corner of Spring Park Ave and Burr Street in JP just 2 blocks from Stony Brook and the center of town and the Pond. The rooms are available 9/1 and the rent will be $766 each plus utilities (gas heat, reasonable). It is first floor of a 2 floor condo. It feels like a home rather than an apartment. My landlord is incredible. She has consciously kept the rent under market to keep us there. The apartment is full of light and love.

There is laundry on site and no pets are allowed.
