### How did the coaching help you move towards your goals?

Coaching has helped me develop sustainable systems that as I continue to work on them become more resilient and capable of operating in a way that is continuous, steady, adaptable, open, celebratory, and grounded.

### What do you appreciate about me as a coach?

Your sense of humor, your honesty, your curiosity and your ability to push back when you need to.

### What do you appreciate about how I coach?

Your ability to turn any moment into a moment of coaching, learning, building or celebration.
