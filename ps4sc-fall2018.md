## ways to stay in touch with the group

* **going to see the moth live**: please fill out [this doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/fiinp3wefgq5b7bf) to see which upcoming boston dates work for most/all of us. if we can't find a good-enough 2018 date, i'll look towards 2019!
* **dinner at rosann's**: i'll be in touch with rosann to get more details about how this could work and then i'll be in touch with yall. 
* **like moths to a flame**: this is a fun storytelling side-project of mine. the goal is to build (verbal) storytelling muscles by practicing making up a 5-minute story once a month. how does it work? at the beginning of each month, i grab a prompt from the moth and email it to the group. then, each of us uploads an audio recording of our story to a private soundcloud account. i include the account info for the account in the emails to the group and all the files remain private so only people who have login access can listen. the only requests are that (a) you keep your story to five minutes or less and (b) you give feedback to at least one other story per month. the next round starts nov 1 and will be 3 months: nov 2018, dec 2018, and jan 2019. after that, i'll decide if another round should open up or if the project will evolve. _if you're interested in participating, email me by oct 31 so i can add you to the list._
