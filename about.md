>I believe in the power of love to create justice and the power of story to make new worlds possible. I imagine radical alternatives to our existing reality not as an escape but as a strategy. I dream of a world where liberation is practiced all the time (not imagined as "over there" or "in the future"). My work in building that world is to support transformation at all scales.

>At the scale of the individual, I support transformation through 1on1 [coaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/coaching) and storytelling. At the scale of organizations, I [facilitate]({{ site.baseurl }}/facilitation) organizational development as a means to support groups of people to move through or transform in relationship to barriers. My organizational work most often intervenes at the intersection of white supremacy and toxic patriarchy and frequently involves communications and narrative strategy. At the network scale, I support ecosystem transformation by working with people to think like a network and then act accordingly.

In 2022 (and every year in the future), I am committing 1% of my revenue to local indigenous-led organizations or organizing through [an honor tax](http://lqb2.co/blog///2022/01/22/honor-tax/){:target="_blank"} as a step towards contributing to a reparative culture.
