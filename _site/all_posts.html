<h2 id="radical-hope"><a href="">radical hope</a></h2>

<p>i felt like i had to read this book given the radical imagination work grant and i have been interested in doing lately. it’s a lovely collection of letters and  a quick read that i probably read too fast. has past, present, and future directed letters and the range of voices and letter recipients is wonderful. i should go back and find some of my favorites and mark them for future teaching materials</p>

<h2 id="bloodchild-and-other-stories"><a href="">bloodchild and other stories</a></h2>

<p>it’s pretty insane that butler can pack just as much into her short stories as she does with her novels. she does it repeatedly in this collection. the opening story, bloodchild - the title for the collection, whops a mind bending wallop and the final story, martha’s book, a story about the nature of divinity, hit me so powerfully at exactly the right moment (during the evolutionary leadership workshop at chanel rock on cortes island). butler’s ability to take the basic underlying premises of our lives, keep them, but bend them just enough to make me rethink the whole world is astounding.</p>

<h2 id="the-dispossessed"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6602919-the-dispossessed">the dispossessed</a></h2>

<p>this book. just. wow. i saw another review somewhere that said this line (which i fully agree with): “this book is philosophy disguised as sci-fi.” it starts out slow, but it’s all brilliantly planned. i love how elements that seem totally mundane and useless come back around as plot points or in the conversations of characters later on.</p>

<p>the book to me felt like a deep exploration of human societal structures and the lengths to which we can go to build systems and societies that still don’t allow us to be ourselves. because maybe it’s not possible to have a static society that can ever contain in equilibrium all that is humanity. the setting is two somewhat mirror planets where one is capitalist and patriarchal and the other is anarchist. i haven’t even fully disgested the depths to which this book shook up my thinking about societal structures so i hope to re-read it and think through it more completely.</p>

<p>my favorite thing about the book was the sections about time. i’m going to quote those sections extensively once i get them all typed up.</p>

<p>if you haven’t yet read the book, here’s a pro-tip i wish i’d had before starting: read the wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed#Plot_summary">plot summary</a> before starting. maybe i could’ve figured out what was happening but i didn’t until the very end. it would have saved me much head/heartache.</p>

<h2 id="killing-and-dying-stories"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848562-killing-and-dying">killing and dying: stories</a></h2>

<p>this is an excellent little graphic novel that has six bizarre stories about the often hidden complexity of life. each story, unfathomable to me as real, surfaces dynamics, thoughts, and specific situations as the <em>most</em> real. i don’t even know if i would classify this book as fiction or nonfiction, but regardless of where it falls, it is full of life lessons.</p>

<p>the illustrations are spare, sparse even, and convey oh so much with oh so little. i think this illustration style could be fairly described as poetry.</p>

<h2 id="harriet-tubman-conductor-on-the-underground-railroad"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183211.Harriet_Tubman">harriet tubman: conductor on the underground railroad</a></h2>

<p>i am embarrassed that i knew so little about harriet tubman’s life before reading this book. it felt like it was written for young adults and it was so so good. the author, ann petry, walked a line between poetry and honest brutality. she doesn’t shy away from the hard moments (beatings, whippings) but she paints them with a broad enough brush so the reader can fill in the violence with as little or as much as she knows. the chapters are divided really nicely into different life segments and when strung together, they give an incredible arc to an incredible woman’s life.</p>

<p>also each chapter ends with a section that is about what else is happening in history. it adds a nice layer of contex given that the book could easily be just about the amazingness that is araminta ross (harriet tubman’s birth name).</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-a-gadget"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget">you are not a gadget</a></h2>

<p>this was a profoundly strange and mindblowing book for me. reading it felt like lanier skipped a stone across a pond of time and each chapter was a weird, iridescent splash. the big points that have stuck with me from this book are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if our society holds the computer as god, we must diminish  ourselves as infinitely complex beings in order to allow the computer to render us.</li>
  <li>lock-in is a bigger problem in tech than in other spheres and industries. for example, midi is made up into bits and will never be able to capture completely the sound of a trombone glissando. and yet, midi is the foundational tech for all music in all computing. we may never know what else digital music could’ve sounded like.</li>
  <li>though it is difficult and against the grain, we should perpetually be asking ourselves: how do we shape our tools to support us to be more fully human (and not more machinelike)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="binti">binti</h2>

<p>this is the first time i have deeply agreed with a quoted accolade on a book in a long time. “nnedi okorafor has more imagination on a single page than some other sci fi has in volumes.” this is a beautiful, quick read about a young woman who runs away from home to go to school because she is brilliant. in the process, which is complicated and fucked, she unknowingly (literally) becomes other in order to save/live her life. in the end, her ability to do that saves the lives of many others and opens up new possibilities for … the universe (i think), but she’s not totally clear (at least not by the end of the book) if its a price she was willing to pay. the book is beautifully written and so imaginative that sometimes i had to reread entire pages to make sure i was following all the revelations properly.</p>

<p>i’m super excited to read the next two books in the series.</p>

<h2 id="patternmaster">patternmaster</h2>
<p>the final book in the patternist series, it (mostly) did not disappoint. i’m so glad i read the books in chronological order (as opposed to the order in which they were written). thanks, alex kats-rubin, for that pro-tip.</p>

<p>everything in this universe now fully makes sense because i see how the details in mind of my mind and clay’s ark all cohere. this book, which is about conflict on earth between essentially alien-infected-super-human-animals and humans who have intense telepathic power, brings up all of butler’s favorite subjects. slavery, empathy, the power of the individual and the collective to shape destiny, relationship to planet, and more. this is the only butler book i’ve read so far where the protagonist is a male… must have been early in her writing career. anyway, as always, there were several moments in the reading of this book where i audibly yelped or was trembling because she writes scenes so powerfully. i <em>am</em> beginning to pick up on the gentle ways she slows down the action of a section, usually with description, right before some crazy shit happens.</p>

<p>love it. love it all. can’t wait to real all her stuff.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p>My core values are <strong>love/justice</strong>, <strong>community</strong>, and <strong>transformation</strong>. Other values that are important to me are <strong>self-determination</strong>, <strong>equity</strong>, and <strong>diversity</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="short-vision">Short Vision</h2>
<p>In the future (2041):</p>

<p>I will be known in my community as <strong>loving</strong>, <strong>supportive</strong>, <strong>strategic</strong>, and <strong>visionary</strong>. My community will be <strong>diverse</strong>, <strong>interdependent</strong>, and <strong>creative</strong>. The planet will be <strong>resilient</strong>, <strong>free</strong>, and <strong>successfully balance chaos and order</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="extended-vision">Extended Vision</h2>

<p>In the future (2041):</p>

<p>I will be known in my community as <strong>loving</strong>, <strong>supportive</strong>, <strong>strategic</strong>, and <strong>visionary</strong>. In my work towards justice for the planet and people, the legacy of my work in my community will show that I am loving and <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-2">care deeply about supporting others</a>. That support will be visible from the micro (1on1) to the macro (facilitation of large groups). I will be trusted as someone who can think critically and move effectively towards systemic goals in systems of all sizes. I will be known as someone who creates space for vision (the visions of others as well as my own) by being aligned with myself and the truest self of others.</p>

<p>My community will be <strong>diverse</strong>, <strong>interdependent</strong>, and <strong>creative</strong>. My community will have many different types of people (ability, race, gender, class, culture, age, location, etc.) who understand and lean into their inextricable connectedness while also holding their own unique differences and wholenesses. Our interdependence on each other and the broader non-human world is one of the sources of our creativity. This creativity (as well as love for each other) must be harnessed to keep us moving towards a better world that also supports us to be more human humans.</p>

<p>The planet and places humans live will be <strong>resilient</strong>, <strong>free</strong>, and hold both <strong>chaos</strong> and <strong>order</strong>. Life will be understood as change. Ecosystems at all scales will have enough complexity and biodiversity to handle significant shocks while continuing their capacities to carry life. But not just any life; non-self-terminating life, life that is increasingly able to experience liberation, freedom.<sup>1</sup> Humans will learn to recognize, accept, and align with the reality that all successful life is a perpetual dance of chaos and order.<sup>2</sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>My personal definition of liberation: joy untouched by fear. Drawing on the words of Nina Simone via “Freedom Is a Feeeling! Freedom Is No Fear!” – Nina Simone – New York, 1968, 2016. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD8f2m8WGI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD8f2m8WGI</a>.</li>
  <li>“But it is also a world that seeks order. When chaos erupts, it not only destroys the current structure, it also creates the conditions for new order to emerge. Change always involves a dark night when everything falls apart. Yet if this period of dissolution is used to create new meaning, then chaos ends and new order emerges.” Margaret Wheatley. <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html">Leadership Lessons for The Real World</a>. 2006. <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html">http://margaretwheatley.com/articles/leadershiplessons.html</a></li>

<p>Hello friends,</p>

<p>Hope you’re enjoying a lovely long weekend!</p>

<p>Eli and I are looking for a place to live and given the craziness of the market here we’d so appreciate your help! </p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any hot tips on apartments in your building or neighborhood, a broker or landlord you like that might know of places, etc etc.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a non-luxury situation, lease starting 9/1, 1-2 bedrooms (I work from home), and nice light. We’re more familiar with Cambridge / Somerville but are open to other locations. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any info you have. </p>

<h2 id="1br1ba-on-clinton-st-in-cambridge-1800">1br/1ba on Clinton st in Cambridge ($1800)</h2>

<p>Hey folks!</p>

<p>Cole and I have lived for five happy years in a very large floor-through 1br/1ba on Clinton st in Cambridge (central square, 2 blocks north of city hall).</p>

<p>We had a baby last August and are moving into a two bedroom either in mid June or early July- we’re hoping to find someone to take the last 4-6 weeks of our lease. Can you folks forward this along to anyone who might be looking for housing soon?</p>

<h3 id="about-the-unit">About the unit:</h3>

<p>The rent is $1800 and includes heat and hot water.</p>

<h4 id="upsides">Upsides:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Landlords live on the first floor and are super friendly, (we sometimes go over for coffee or a glass of wine) and very attentive. If there’s a problem, the issue is literally dealt with within 24 hours of us letting them know.</li>
  <li>Over the almost five years we’ve lived here, they only raised the rent once ($50) and generally like to keep the rent low and stable for good tenants.</li>
  <li>It’s a small building, an older couple lives on the second floor (they’ve lived here for decades) and are friendly- though they are loud during the Superbowl.</li>
  <li>The unit is on the top floor so it’s very quiet.</li>
  <li>The bedroom is huge, as in you could probably fit 7 or 8 queen sized mattresses in just the bedroom.</li>
  <li>There is a beautiful American Elm tree outside the living room that provides shade in the summer and stunning yellow leaves in the fall.</li>
  <li>Landlords allow cats.</li>
  <li>There is a bike rack installed in the driveway.</li>
  <li>There is parking available for an additional fee.</li>
  <li>It’s very bright and sunny. Even in rainy weather we rarely turn on the overhead lights during the day.</li>
  <li>Electric utilities usually cost us about $35/mo. There is a new, energy efficient fridge.</li>
  <li>It’s two blocks north of city hall and three blocks north of the Central Square (red line) station.</li>
  <li>Insane amount of closet space (two walk-in closets in the living room and five closets in the bedroom.</li>
  <li>We love our neighbors SO much and have formed incredibly close relationships with them- they are awesome! The couple next door has lived in their house since the early 1950s and has become like a second set of grandparents to our daughter. Our across the street neighbor is now one of our closest family friends and we trade cat sitting services and hang out with our neighbors down the block.</li>
  <li>There’s a working, full-size portable dishwasher that we bought and are happy to leave behind because our new place has a dishwasher. It connects to the faucet but the downside is that you can’t use the sink or stove while the dishwasher is running.</li>
  <li>The unit does get warm in the summer, but the landlords include two window unit air conditioners- so you don’t need to buy one if you want AC.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="downsides">Downsides:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The sink and oven (4 burner electric) are “efficiency sized”- but we cook for almost every meal and have made it work.</li>
  <li>The living room and bedroom have recently replaced carpets that are in very good condition- I just hate carpeting because it means you have to vacuum. The kitchen and dining room have beautiful original wood floors.</li>
  <li>While we have a washing machine in unit- we bought it ourselves and are taking it with us. There is a laundry hookup in the unit, but it is unlikely that the landlords will allow you to have a machine- but you can ask- they might be open to it.</li>
  <li>The ceilings in the kitchen and living room are low- about 6’8” or 7’. My husband is 6’1” and finds it manageable. I’m 5’5” and I have no problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>We would definitely stay in this apartment and hold onto it for dear life if we didn’t think we needed a second bedroom.</p>

<h3 id="posted-6-jan-2018">Posted: 6 Jan 2018</h3>

<p>Recently-renovated, super-sunny 2-bedroom apartment right off the 3/4 Crown Heights/Utica stop available for February. This is a large, lovely apartment with an open layout and an exceptional amount of light, situated on the 4th (top) floor corner (south and west facing windows) of a ~20 unit walk-up building. There are two sinks, nice appliances, a combo washer-dryer unit, an island in the open kitchen area, and a long entryway good for storing bikes, shoes, etc. The bedrooms are slightly different sizes, but both have large closets and easily fit queen-sized beds. It’s a really beautiful spot. Rent is $2,500/mo.</p>

<p>We are looking for people to take over our lease through August 2018 (or August 2019 if preferred). We can be flexible on the specific start date in February, and we’ll help facilitate with the landlord.</p>

<h3 id="posted-24-june-2017">Posted: 24 June 2017</h3>

<p>My two roommates are moving out and I am looking for new lovely people to join me in creating a home. I thought you all might be or know some amazing people who’d be interested. </p>

<p>It’s on the corner of Spring Park Ave and Burr Street in JP just 2 blocks from Stony Brook and the center of town and the Pond. The rooms are available 9/1 and the rent will be $766 each plus utilities (gas heat, reasonable). It is first floor of a 2 floor condo. It feels like a home rather than an apartment. My landlord is incredible. She has consciously kept the rent under market to keep us there. The apartment is full of light and love.</p>

<p>There is laundry on site and no pets are allowed.</p>
