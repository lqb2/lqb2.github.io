title: Work with Me

JULY UPDATE: My 2024 work plate is gloriously and thankfully full for this year. I am now scheduling work beginning in Feb 2025. I have not yet discerned my focus for 2025 so for now it's first come, first serve! 

<center>---</center>

In 2024 my work will be focused in two areas. 

<br>

(1) **Liberation**. This includes but is not limited to: 

- liberatory coaching, and 
- facilitating retreats, workshops, and trainings related to liberation 
- supporting liberatory leaders or capacity building for people wanting to practice liberatory leadership


(2) **Land justice and environmental justice**. This includes (but is not limited to) work related to or support orgs that do:

* land rematriation, 
* land justice, 
* farming, and 
* environmental justice

**My dream projects in 2024** are designing and facilitating multi-day staff retreats for BIPOC or BIPOC-led organizations with a focus on environmental justice.

It is possible I will take on work projects outside of these focus areas but it is my intention to say no to work beyond this focus so I can keep space open for things inside of it. But the bills must be paid so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
