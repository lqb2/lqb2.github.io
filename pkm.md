filters

I also accept that much information will pass me by, but I have faith in my network that, if necessary, I can get help in my knowledge seeking.

More and more I do not trust machine filters unless I know who created them and how. The other issue with public algorithmic filters is that they are open to being gamed. The search engine optimization field is basically designed to game Google search. The Amazon recommendation engine is constantly bombarded with fake reviews.

But if we are to rely less on machines and more on fellow humans we will have to put more effort into our knowledge filtering.

Activity #8
A. Write 50 to 100 words that express your opinion on something that you have read from one of your social media feeds. This opinion does not have to be researched but must be what you feel. It can be for or against other opinions, but put a stake in the ground, and save it. Make a note to check and re-read in a month (so return to this on march 11):

the roots of all of the political, economic, environmental, and social problems we are facing is spiritual. my definition of spirituality is any system or set of practices that helps you understand that everything is connected. in this article (https://www.nirandfar.com/internal-triggers/) by nir eyal, two of the solutions proposed for becoming indistractable are "surfing the urge" and "leaves on a stream." these are both repackaged millennia-old spiritual practices (in buddhism, these might be termed practices of open awareness. in christianity, one umbrella term for these practices is contemplative prayer). i believe the loss of spirituality is keeping us from being in right relationship with our insides. that disconnect is destroying our insides and our outsides.
