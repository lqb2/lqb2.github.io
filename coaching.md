> "A great coach tells you what you need to hear not what you want to hear." — Sagi Kalev

Coaching is my primary pathway to support individuals through transformative change processes. Working with me as a coach generally starts with a free 15-minute chemistry call ([bookable here](https://calendly.com/lqb2co/coaching-chemistry-call){:target="_blank"}) for us to explore if we are mutually excited to work together.

I offer **personal systems coaching**, **liberatory coaching**, and **professional coaching**. 

I created my [personal systems coaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkkuWMfPaB0wcUFwisYbj-znRdkJl2mBFIUpMMeefSU/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} framework and have been offering it since 2016. I have been offering professional coaching since 2019 and [liberatory coaching](https://www.healingjusticeliberation.org/aboutus){:target="_blank"} (training scheduled to complete in Jan 2022) since 2021. I will describe the pathways on our consultation call and if we move forward, we'll make a decision on one or a blended apporach before our first full coaching session. You can find pricing information [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxujZckhY8eIfNRIc_MlCGRGsrQ9t5slfItcBJCF92w/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for individual coaching.

I also offer **professional coaching** to support people in their work context(s). Individuals often use organizational resources to pay for coaching with me. Organizations also hire me (using a retainer) to be available to anyone on their team (this works well for organizations that want to invest in all or frontline/lower-ranking staff). In both cases, I use my [sliding scale organizational consulting rates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0WiPZ8srwWC6SZrD9qVsmDTNQ4gW6YWbDw4tammFU8/edit){:target="_blank"} to set a compensation amount. If what you're looking for doesn't exactly fit how I typically offer professional coaching, please [reach out]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact) and let's see what's possible. 

For organizations with retainers, ad-hoc calls can be scheduled 1 or more at a time using specific calendly links for your organization. For anyone I work with individually, we will typically start with six sessions, usually over a span of 3-6 months. From there, sessions can be added in sets of three or ad-hoc as we find a rhythm that works for you and your budget. I typically book calls at least 6 weeks in advance and, depending on the season, sometimes farther.

## Working with me in 2022

My coaching plate for 2021 is full and I am beginning to plan out my coaching schedule for 2022. If you are interested in working with me as a coach next year, please add yourself to the waitlist <a href="https://forms.gle/SAMFbiTU4BwkXQi56" target="_blank">here</a>. You'll hear word in November or December about how to get yourself off the waitlist and into a slot!

## Testimonials


> Lawrence is the first professional I have worked with, whom have made me feel safe enough to share myself all the way through. He masters the fine balance of sharing himself to ensure a safe space, while keeping it professional and the focus on you. He is amazing at feeling what is needed it the moment, while directing me forward, towards my goals. — [Niklas W.]({{ site.baseurl }}events/2021/10/24/coaching-testimonial-niklas.html) 

> Lawrence is a great companion to walk alongside you in your journey toward self development and actualizing your career goals. With a radical & holistic approach, he can help you unearth the secrets you already have within. — [Sidra F.]({{ site.baseul }}events/2021/10/24/coaching-testimonial-sidra.html)

> Lawrence has had a transformative effect on my life in the past few years... Life-coaching is at times an inadequate term for what this process looks like... And the remarkable thing has been that when we have set intentions, goals, and done these visioning exercises... usually within a year of me articulating an intention, my life transforms in such a manner that those intentions are realized. — [Huma G.]({{ site.baseurl}}events/2020/10/11/coaching-testimonial-huma.html)

> Lawrence is a special mix of enormous heart (e.g. deep listening, empathy), brilliant mind (e.g. insights, connections), and connected soul (e.g. groundedness, *big* picture). What else could you want in a coach??<br>
— [Jaco Cohen]({{ site.baseurl}}events/2020/10/13/coaching-testimonial-jaco.html)

> I appreciate Lawrence’s active listening and deep engagement with what I expressed as my goals, struggles, and challenges. While his practice had its own shape, it felt very much like Lawrence adapted his coaching practice to the goals that I wanted to achieve, the problems I identified, and the shifts I wanted to make (and learned that I wanted to make through coaching!)...
