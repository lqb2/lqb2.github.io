### Testimonials

> Hi Lawrence,
A note to say I appreciate you so much.  Thank you for your sensitive, generous and creative facilitation.  You have a very special presence. <br> _— 2020 Spring workshop participant_

> I just wanted to thank you for being such a dynamic and thoughtful leader for us this week. As you know, I had deep anxiety and I am not only relieved but excited about what is to come. You created a safe space that I was unsure was possible -- one where we could all connect and be honest and display vulnerability and learn from each other. Thank you.<br>
_– 2019 Leadership team retreat_

### Pricing

I use a sliding scale for my [facilitation/consulting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0WiPZ8srwWC6SZrD9qVsmDTNQ4gW6YWbDw4tammFU8/edit) and [coaching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxujZckhY8eIfNRIc_MlCGRGsrQ9t5slfItcBJCF92w/edit). These scales are inspired by <a href="http://aorta.coop/rates/">Aorta</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eiT7EbIf300i_iTJtfzi7aoXUuvSj9hXJVWNG-NRiuo/edit">generative somatics</a>. They take into consideration historic forces of oppression and aim to make my services available to people equitably. I am very open to negotiating pricing based on budget constraints, <a href="http://www.lawrencebarrinerii.com/vision" target="_blank">values alignment</a>, opportunities for future work, and more. Don't hesitate to ask.
